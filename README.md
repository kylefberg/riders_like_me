## Intro

If you are a new motorcycle rider, or have been riding for quite some time but have moved into a new area and don't know other riders, this app is for you.   

Riders Like Me is an app where you can create a profile to share with other riders listing your riding experience, interests and contact information. If you are looking for new friends, you can look through other rider profiles and leave comments on their page.

###TECHNOLOGIES

The app is designed in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Bootstrap where the page layout and styling take place. I developed the backend and database using Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

I pushed the app to GitHub so that my progress could be tracked and each 
step would be saved.    

I then pushed to Heroku so the rest of the world could enjoy this awesome app and find some forever friends.  

###DESIGN

My app started with a frustration I had in finding people who are interested in the same things I am to ride with. I started by 
doing several wire frames to get an idea of what I wanted my final project to
look like. I then developed an ERD so I would be able to plan out the structure of the app.    
  
I then wrote over two dozen user stories mapping out the process I planned on using along with breaking each step into bite size pieces. [Trello Link](https://trello.com/b/FOi7VLvM/riders-like-me) I organized 
each action item into pages so I could track the flow of a user experience. This helped me 
organize each step and also served as a reminder to push to GitHub often.

###NEXT STEPS

In my icebox I have several ideas to improve the existing app. Some of those 
ideas include creating a search feature so riders can search by common interests or experience. The search results would then be displayed for you to look through and contact the people you are interested in.    

Another icebox idea is to make the ability to friend another rider and have a friend list that captures all of your friends.
